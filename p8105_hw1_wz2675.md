``` r

data("early_january_weather")
```

# Problem 1

## Part 1

Inside the dataset `early_january_weather`, there are 15 variables
including “origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir,
wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour” with 358
observations. Among all the variables, I noticed that the variable
“wind_gust” have many values of “NA”, this might due to loss of the data
in most of the time and we need to omit those NA values when we want to
find a pattern regarding this variable. Moving on, we noticed that the
mean temperature in this data set is 39.5821229 degrees Fahrenheit using
variables `temp` to get the answer.

## Part 2

Next we are going to make a scatter plot

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_wz2675_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("time_hour_vs_temp_on_humidity_scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

We noticed that starting from January 1st to January 10th the
temperature keeps steady between 20-50 degrees Fahrenheit, the humidity
is also below 60 with few hours exceeding the value. Beginning from
January 10th, the temperature reaches highest to 60 degrees Fahrenheit
with humidity beyond 80 and drop back to 40 degrees Fahrenheit and
around 60 humidity after Jan 14th.

# Problem 2

``` r
p2_df =
  tibble(
    vec_num = rnorm(10),
    vec_log = vec_num > 0,
    vec_chr = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", 
                "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten"),
    vec_fac = factor(c("Good", "Good", "Good", "Fair", "Fair", 
                       "Fair", "Fair", "Bad", "Bad", "Bad"))
  )
```

Now trying to calculate the mean of each variables in the data frame.

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, 1))
```

    ## [1] -0.3110556

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, 2))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, 3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, 3)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, 4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, 4)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We noticed that only numeric and logical variables are able to have
numeric means, which only the first columns got a result. The character
and factor variables are not able to have means.

Now we turn the logical, character, and factor variables into numeric to
see if they can have mean:

``` r
num_log = as.numeric(pull(p2_df, 2))
num_chr = as.numeric(pull(p2_df, 3))
num_fac = as.numeric(pull(p2_df, 4))
```

After applying the `as.numeric` function, we see that the logical and
factor variable can be transformed into numeric value where character
variable still cannot be transformed. Moreover, although factor
variables have numeric values, it cannot be used to calculate mean since
the numeric value only represents different levels of the original
variable. Thus, all these results shows that only numeric and logical
variables can have a mean from the data frame.
