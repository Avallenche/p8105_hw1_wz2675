# Problem 1

## Part 1

Inside the dataset `early_january_weather`, there are 15 variables
including “origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir,
wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour” with 358
observations. Among all the variables, we focusing on the `temperature`
variable inside the dataset. We noticed that the mean temperature in
this data set is 39.5821229 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Part 2

Next we are going to make a scatter plot

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_wz2675_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("time_hour_vs_temp_on_humidity_scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

We noticed that starting from January 1st to January 10th the
temperature keeps steady between 20-50 degrees Fahrenheit, the humidity
is also below 60 with few hours exceeding the value. Beginning from
January 10th, the temperature reaches highest to 60 degrees Fahrenheit
with humidity beyond 80 and drop back to 40 degrees Fahrenheit and
around 60 humidity after Jan 14th.

# Problem 2

``` r
p2_df =
  tibble(
    vec_num = rnorm(10),
    vec_log = vec_num > 0,
    vec_chr = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", 
                "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten"),
    vec_fac = factor(c("Good", "Good", "Good", "Fair", "Fair", 
                       "Fair", "Fair", "Bad", "Bad", "Bad"))
  )
```

Now trying to calculate the mean of each variables in the data frame.

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, 1))
```

    ## [1] 0.04232601

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, 2))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, 3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, 3)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, 4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, 4)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We noticed that only numeric and logical vectors are able to have
numeric means, which only the first columns got a result. The character
and factor vector are not able to have means.

Now we turn the logical, character, and factor vectors into numeric to
see if they can have mean

``` r
num_log = as.numeric(pull(p2_df, 2))
num_chr = as.numeric(pull(p2_df, 3))
num_fac = as.numeric(pull(p2_df, 4))
```
